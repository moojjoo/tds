# Escalation Letter – TDS Account (Mooresville, NC)

**To:** TDS

---

## Dear TDS,

I’m writing regarding my TDS account associated with the Mooresville, NC service area  
(local office: *435 South Broad Street, Mooresville, NC 28115*).

---

## Summary of Issue

- On **August 18, 2025**, your offshore representative confirmed on a recorded call that my account balance was **$0.00** and that the account was resolved/closed.  
- Despite that assurance, I have spent significant time addressing follow-up items related to returning equipment and clarifying the account status.  
- I’ve attached my letter detailing the sequence of events and the equipment return.  
- My professional hourly rate is **$150.00**, and I have already spent **eight (8) hours** dealing with this matter, which would Total **$1,200.00**.  

---

## What I’m Requesting

1. **Written confirmation** that my account is closed with a **$0.00 balance**.  
2. **Confirmation** that all returned equipment has been received and my account reflects no pending obligations.  
3. **Consideration of a goodwill check** reflecting my time spent due to process errors/miscommunication:  
   - 8 hours × $150/hr = **$1,050.00** (includes two extra hours for social media campaign to get a response or apology).  
4. **Review of the August 18, 2025 call recording** in which the representative states the balance and status noted above.

## Additional Notes

Frankly, it is a **shame and a disgrace** to our country, the United States of America, and as a **Veteran of the United States Army (Armed Forces)**, I find it especially disappointing that American companies like TDS rely on offshore representatives or H1B workers to handle U.S. customer support.  

How in the *“Sam Hill”* could this not be handled properly and immediately at your Mooresville, NC office? *SMH.*  

I appreciate your attention and a swift resolution. If you need any additional information (account number, return tracking, or dates), please refer to the attached letter.

## Attachments

- **Evidence of Equipment returned**
    File: [All Equipment returned](https://github.com/moojjoo/tds/blob/main/20250915_TDS.pdf) 
    Note: after the fact that I attempted to return and the TDS office was closed in June due to a power outage when all street lights and everything else in Mooresville (Zip 28115 was operational).

- **Original bill**
    File: [July 16, 2025 STATEMENT OF SERVICE](https://github.com/moojjoo/tds/blob/main/20250915_Receipt_01a.pdf)  
    Note: considering I used your services for 1 month this should be half this bill brining it to $84.45, but since I have spent hours writing you over and over without a response, this should be zero and the case closed.

- **Current bill**
    File: [August 16, 2025](https://github.com/moojjoo/tds/blob/main/20250915_Receipt_01.pdf)
    Note: again see [All Equipment returned](https://github.com/moojjoo/tds/blob/main/20250915_TDS.pdf) and again all the hours of scanning and preparing documentation.  Just close the account and cut ties with me, and as you can see below I was told the balance was $0.00. on *August 18, 2025*
